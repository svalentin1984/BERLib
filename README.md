# BERLib: A Basic Encoding Rules Implementation

This projects offers a BER (Basic Encoding Rules) implementation in three programming languages (C, C++, C#) that offers encoding and decoding of data types in order to be used in serialization and deserialization
processes in communication protocols. The implementation is consistent with the currently active
standards and it also offers a great degree of scalability enabling the programmer to adapt it according to
the needs of the project. BERLib is also highly documented and significant examples are provided for all the
programming languages used. Our work qualifies as an ideal solution for providing data encoding and decoding
in communication protocol design especially for Wireless Sensor Networks and Internet of Things.
